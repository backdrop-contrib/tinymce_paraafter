# TinyMCE paragraph after

TinyMCE plugin to insert a new paragraph after block level elements.

When you have block elements like tables, div, blockquote... directly following
 each other in content, it can be tricky to "squeeze" in other content. TinyMCE
 does provide options to do so, but that's not always the same (downwards arrow
 at the end of table, double enter inside blockquote). Not always easy to
 remember. Sometimes it's even impossible (like in nested div or in address tags).

In this case, this plugin comes to the rescue.

Hit the button and keep on writing. ;-)
